### 1) Personalized Workout Plan Suggesting System







### 2) Personalized Real-Time Exercise Pose Detection and Correction

This Component focuses on the development of a Personalized Real-Time Exercise Pose Detection and Correction System. The system utilizes Machine Learning (ML) techniques, specifically a Random Forest Classifier, to classify and analyze various exercise poses based on real-time body landmarks. By providing personalized feedback, this solution aims to improve exercise performance, minimize the risk of injuries caused by improper form, and support fitness enthusiasts in achieving their goals.

Key Features -:

The Personalized Real-Time Exercise Pose Detection and Correction system ensures accurate real-time pose detection for exercises like push-ups and squats using body landmarks. It provides instant corrective feedback, personalized recommendations based on user performance, and alerts to prevent injuries from improper movements. A user-friendly mobile app prototype designed in Figma enhances accessibility and usability for all fitness levels

How It Works -: 

1.	Input Data -:   o	The system processes 3D body landmarks (e.g., coordinates of shoulders, elbows, knees) captured in real-time.
